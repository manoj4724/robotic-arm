IMPORTANT THINGS TO FOCUS ON 
- Selecting the servors (i made a mistake of selecting 360 servo which works on rotation, but we neec 180 servo which works on angle)
- Select appropriate firmware according to your applicarion or requirement.
- Microcontroller which is suitable and has wifi or bluetooth module integrated in it, which helps in reducing the work of getting a seperate module and then developing the application interface.
- Learning inverse kinamatics to calcuate the positon and the angle of the robotic arm to reach the object.
